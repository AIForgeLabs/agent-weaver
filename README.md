Welcome to the **AgentWeaver Framework**, an experimental project by **AIForgeLabs** exploring the potential of autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for collaborative software development.

## Overview

AgentWeaver aims to define and simulate a sophisticated ecosystem where multiple specialized AI agents, each embodying a specific role (like Founder, CTO, Architect, Developer, Tester, etc.), collaborate to take a software project from idea to deployment with minimal human intervention.

The core concepts behind AgentWeaver include:

* **Agent Specialization:** Employing distinct agents with specific skills and responsibilities, mirroring roles in human development teams.
* **Layered Architecture:** Organizing agents and processes into layers, such as [Strategic Planning](../docs/concepts/strategic_planning_layer.md), [Orchestration](../docs/concepts/orchestration_layer.md), and Operational Execution.
* **Knowledge Management:** Utilizing a central knowledge system ([LoreMaster](../docs/agents/loremaster.md)) to maintain context, history, and shared understanding across agents, often leveraging [Chain-of-Thought (CoT)](../docs/concepts/chain_of_thought.md) logging.
* **Tooling (MCP):** Defining a set of tools ([Model Control Protocol Tools](../docs/tools/README.md)) that agents can use to perform specific actions like searching the web, analyzing code, managing tasks, or interacting with external systems.
* **Automated Workflows:** Defining standard operating procedures, like the [Feature Development Workflow](../docs/workflows/feature_development_flow_v1_5_refined.md), to guide agent collaboration.
* **Human Supervision:** Integrating points for [Human Supervision](../docs/concepts/human_supervision.md) for critical decisions, feedback, and oversight.

## Key Agents

The framework defines numerous specialized agents (~18+). Some of the core roles include:

* **Strategic:** `Founder`, `CTO`, `Strategos`
* **Orchestration & Planning:** `Orchestrator`, `Project Manager AI`
* **Knowledge & Communication:** `LoreMaster`, `Inter-Agent Communicator`
* **Core Development:** `Business Analyst`, `Architect`, `Backend Developer`, `Frontend Developer`
* **Quality & Operations:** `Tester`, `Docs Writer`, `DevOps`, `Security Analyst`, `Performance Engineer`

> For a complete list and detailed descriptions of all agents, please see the [Agents Documentation](../docs/agents/README.md).

## Project Vision & Goals

The ultimate vision for AgentWeaver is to create a highly autonomous, adaptable, and efficient system capable of:

* Accelerating software development cycles.
* Improving code quality through specialized AI oversight and testing.
* Enabling the creation of complex software with reduced human effort.
* Exploring the dynamics and potential of collaborative AI teams.

## Current Status

This repository currently contains the **definition and conceptual framework** for the AgentWeaver system (v1.5 based on the documentation). It includes detailed descriptions of agent personas, core concepts, tool requirements, and potential workflows.

The system is **experimental** and not yet implemented as a fully functional software platform.

## Roadmap / Future Plans (Conceptual)

* Implement the core `Orchestrator` agent logic.
* Define and potentially build prototypes for key [MCP Tools](../docs/tools/README.md).
* Refine agent interaction protocols and communication flows.
* Develop the `LoreMaster` knowledge base integration.
* Experiment with implementing specific workflows using LLMs and the defined agent personas.
* Integrate real-world feedback and testing.
